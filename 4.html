    <h1>MS-Word (Word Processor)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MS-Word is a text editing or word processing software developed by Microsoft Corporation, USA under the MS-Office package. Word processing refers to the use of a computer to create, edit, and print documents. A word processor enables us to create a document, store it electronically on a disk, display it on a screen, modify it by entering commands and characters from the keyboard, and print it on a printer. MS-Word is a Windows-based application with many powerful and advanced features to manipulate documents. With the help of this program, we can create any type of documents like letters, reports, theses, manuals, brochures, advertisements, and many other documents. Besides creating, editing, and modifying documents, MS-Word provides special facilities such as checking spelling and grammatical errors, searching for synonyms and antonyms, working with columns, tables, special symbols, pictures, graphs, charts, and more. The document created with MS-Word has “.doc” extension, while the newer version has the “.docx” extension.</p>

    <h1>MS-Excel (Spreadsheet)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MS-Excel is a spreadsheet software in the Microsoft Office suite that allows users to store, organize, and analyze numerical and text data. It is part of the MS-Office package. A spreadsheet program presents information clearly and can be used to perform mathematical calculations using various formulas and equations. Excel also allows us to convert spreadsheet data into various charts like bar graphs, columns, and others. It can be used to calculate data according to user needs, such as salary sheets, income and expenses statements, balance sheets, budget preparation, and grade and percentage calculations. Some application areas of Excel include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic mathematical calculation</li>
        <li>Financial modeling and analysis</li>
        <li>Statistical analysis</li>
        <li>Scientific and engineering calculations</li>
        <li>Graphic presentation and more</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The extension of MS-Excel files is “.xlsx” and “.xls”.</p>

    <h2>Common Terminologies Used in Spreadsheet</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Worksheet (Spreadsheet):</dt>
        <dd>A worksheet is a collection of rows and columns used to list, organize, and calculate data.</dd>

        <dt>Workbook:</dt>
        <dd>The files used in a spreadsheet are collectively known as a workbook. Workbooks are made up of several worksheets. By default, one workbook has three worksheets.</dd>

        <dt>Cell:</dt>
        <dd>The intersection of rows and columns is called a cell. To refer to a cell, enter a column letter followed by a row number (e.g., C2). The cell where the intersection occurs is called the active cell.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Features of MS-Excel</h2>

    </dl>

    <h2>Cell Reference in Excel</h2>
    <p>A cell location in a spreadsheet is referred to as its cell reference. To find a cell reference, look at the column heading to find which column the cell is in and across to find which row it is in. The cell reference is a combination of the column letter and row number, such as A1, B3, Z9. The column letter should always come first when writing a cell reference. This is particularly important when writing formulas or addressing cells. For example, to add values 3 and 2 located in A1 and A2 respectively, instead of writing A3=3+2, we write A3=A1+A2.</p>

    <h3>Types of Cell Reference</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Relative Cell Reference:</dt>
        <dd>A relative cell reference identifies the location of a cell or group of cells. By default, a spreadsheet cell reference is relative, meaning formulas and functions can be copied and pasted to other cells. Examples include A1, B4, G9, etc.</dd>

        <dt>Absolute Cell Reference:</dt>
        <dd>An absolute cell reference identifies a specific cell location, indicated by a dollar sign ($) before the column letter and row number (e.g., $A$2, $G$9). This keeps the cell reference fixed when copying formulas or functions.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h1>MS-PowerPoint (Presentation)</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>PowerPoint is the presentation software in the Microsoft Office suite. With PowerPoint, we can create dynamic and professional presentations using pre-defined layouts, themes, and templates. PowerPoint includes all the features needed to produce professional-looking presentations. A PowerPoint presentation consists of a series of slides that contain information we want to communicate with our audience. This information can include text, images, graphs, charts, videos, audio, and more. The presentation program can also be used as a supplement to older visual aid technologies such as pamphlets, handouts, posters, and chalkboards.</p>
    <p>The extension of PowerPoint files is “.ppt”, while later versions use “.pptx”. Alternative software for MS-PowerPoint includes MagicPoint, Apple Keynote, IBM Lotus, and Harvard Graphics.</p>
