<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and interpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing  and produce a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.</p>

<h1>Introduction to computer system</h1>
<div>Computer system is a Combination on hardware, software and peripherals which are organized together to run our computer system smoothly. Basically, our computer System works on IPO (Input Process Output) cycle. So, it is mandatory/compulsory to have different unit work together as a whole in order  to convert raw facts and figure into meaningful information. Without any one of these unit computer starts malfunctioning. 
The design, arrangement, construction or organization a different parts of computer system is known as computer architecture. It is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system. It is a framework which focus in how CPU performs internal operation. So computer architecture may also be define as the science and art of selection, inter connecting hardware components to create computer to meet functional performance and cost.</div>
<br>
<h1>Components/Elements of Computer System</h1>
<div>A Computer System has several have several basic components or elements which are listed below:</div>
<dl>
    <dt>Hardware ( Input, Output, Processing and storage )</dt>
    <dd>Hardware is the physical devices on the computer which we can touch and see With out hardware, software cannot work it include input device, output device, processing device and storage device for example: device like keyboard, mouse, CPU, hard disk and RAM are commonly  used hardware devices.</dd>
    <dt>Software</dt>
    <dd>The collection set of instruction is known as program.which performs some specific function. These programs are integrated together in order to work as a software. Software describes how hardware should function and helps in popper utilization and mobilization of computer hardware.For eg. Operating system, MS-Office, Billing software etc.</dd>
    <dt>Data/Information</dt>
    <dd>The raw facts and figures that are isolated, uninterpreted, and doesn't give any sense is known as data. Data are fed into the computer for processing as a input though Input devices. Whereas, the meaningful result obtained after processing data according to the supplied instruction is known as information. Information generally are the processed version of data which are obtain as output through output device.</dd>
    <dt>Procedure</dt>
    <dd> Procedure are the description of how things are done.It includes steps for converting raw fact and figure into meaningful information. It include the general guidelines of how computer should be used.</dd>
    <dt>People</dt>
    <dd>It is the most important part of the computer system. People operate the computer hardware and create the computer software.  People helps to generate command to operate the computer system. Without user no hardware and software can be mobilized.</dd>
    <dt>Communication </dt>
    <dd>Once the computer system is setup,  there is tremendous amount of data flow between user to computer and vice-versa. The data are shared among different components of our computer System in the form of electronic signal. The exchange of data and information between several components can also be termed as communication.</dd>
</dl>
<br><br>
<h1>Basic hardware components of a computer system</h1>
<dl>
    <dt>Input unit</dt>
    <dd>Data and instruction must enter the computer system before any computation can be perform on the supply data. Input device accepts data and instruction from the user, hence the device or the unit which is used to fed raw facts and figures to the computer system  for processing along with set of instruction is called input unit. 
        It also converts input data into suitable form that is accepted by the computer System. Generally, it act as a interface/bridge or medium through which communication between user and computer takes place. In short following are the functions performed by the input unit
    <ol>
        <li>It accepts the list of instruction and data from the outside world.</li>
        <li>It converts the supplied instruction and data into computer acceptable form that is binary code.</li>
        <li>It supplies the converted instruction and data to the computer system for further processing.</li>
    </ol>
    Some of the commonly used input device are:<br>
    Keyboard , track pad, touchscreen, mouse, light pen, scanner, BCR, MICR, OCR, joystick ,trackball etc</dd>
    <dt>Output Unit</dt>
    <dd>The job of an output unit is just the reverse of an input unit. It supplies information and result of computation to the outside world. Thus, it links computer with the external environment. It consists of device that translate information processed by the computer into a form that human can understand. The computer processed information consist of Os and 1 which need to be translated into letters, numbers, special symbols, pictures etc that people can understand. In short following are the function performed by an output unit:
        <ol>
            <li>It accepts the result produce by the computer which is not understandable to us.</li>
            <li>It converts the result into human understandable form.</li>
            <li>It supplies the converted results to the outside world.</li>
        </ol>
        Commonly used output device are:<br>
        Monitor, printers, speakers, plotters etc.<br>
        There are two types of output device.
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Hard Copy output </li>
            <li>Soft Copy output</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>   
    <dt>Hard copy output:</dt>
    <dd>These type of output are in print form on the paper or some material that can be touched and carried for being shown to other. It is permanent in nature. So that we can look after these output even there is no computer. Unlike soft copy output, these type of output does not need continuous supply of power. for example, Output produce in paper or other material by printer or plotter is known as hard copy output and the device is known as hard copy output device. The commonly used hard copy output devices are printer and plotter.</dd>    
    <dt>Soft copy output:</dt>
    <dd>Soft copy output refers to the data shown on display screen or produced by speaker. These type output is untouchable. It is temporary in nature that means, output cannot be carried for being shown to others. These types of output resides only when there is computer or continuous electric supply. It is non-portable compared to hard copy output. for example, Output produced on display screen or sound produced from speaker are soft copy output and whereas the device is known as soft copy output device. The commonly used soft copy output devices are speaker and monitor.</dd>   
    <DT>Central Processing Unit:</DT>
    <DD>he CPU is brain of any computer system. Like in human body, all major decision are taken by the brain Similarly, in computer all major calculation and comparison are made inside the CPU and CPU is also responsible for activating and controlling the operation of other unit of a computer system A micro processor is a single chip that performs the function of CPU in micro-computers. The speed of the microprocessor is measured in terms of Megahertz and Gigahertz. The functions of CPU (processor) are:
        <ol>
            <li>To carry out processing.</li>
            <li>To give command and co-ordinate with all other parts of computer system.</li>
            <li>To control the sequence of operation that takes place in our computer system. </li>
            <li>To helps in memory allocation and controls storage of data and instruction.</li>
        </ol>
        The central processing unit consists of smaller units. They are:
        <ol>
        <li>Arithmetic logic Unit (ALU) </li>
        <li>Control Unit (CU)</li>
        <li>Memory Unit (MU)</li>
        </ol>
        <dl>
            <DT>ALU:</DT>
            <DD>ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. It is one of the most important  unit of processing. Where actual execution of the instruction takes place during processing. It performs arithmetic and logical operations and controls speed of those operations as directed by control unit(CU). To be clear all the calculation and decision are made in ALU. The data and instruction are stored in the primary memory before processing, and are transferred when needed to the ALU. ALU is designed to perform fundamental mathematical operations such addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and logical Operation which perform Comparison between the two or more than two operands to make a solid decision also known as logical operation which consists of logical OR, logical AND and logical NOT.</DD>  
            <DT>CU:</DT>
            <DD>Although, control unit doesn't perform any actual processing on the data , it acts as a central nervous system for other component of the computer. It manages and co-ordinate the entire computer system. It obtain instruction from the program stored in the main memory, interprets the instruction accordingly and issue signal that cause other unit of the system to execute them. Basically, it controls overall operation of the computer. It also controls all other device input/output device connected to the CPU. It directs the movement of electrical signal between main memory to ALU and input-output device. Hence, control unit acts as the nerve system of the computer system.</DD>  
            <DT>MU:</DT>
            <DD>Memory unit is responsible for storing data and instruction either for short or longer period of time. Basically memory unit stores data and instruction before and after processing . As we know, memory are needed for program being currently used or to store data and instruction permanently . Depending upon the nature of data stored memory unit are distinguished into primary memory and secondary memory. Memory unit of CPU is a primary memory where data and instruction are stored temporarily. Where as  the processed data and information can be stored in secondary memory permanently so that user can retrieve information whenever required. There are two types of memory used in our computer system.
                <ol>
                    <li>Primary memory/Main memory </li>
                    <li>Secondary memory/Auxiliary Memory</li>
                </ol>
            </DD>  
        </dl>
    </DD>     
    
    <dt>1. Primary Memory/Main Memory:</dt>
    <dd>Primary Memory is also known as main memory of computer. This is the place where our data and instruction are stored before processing and the result are stored before displaying output. Memory which stores data and information currently being used by the computer is known as primary memory.
        Features of primary memory:
        <ol>
            <li>It is not used to store data permanently.</li>
            <li>It is usually volatile except ROM.</li>
            <li>It is usually expensive and faster than Secondary storage.</li>
            <li>It is normally used for smaller storage.</li>
            <li>It is not used to transfer data from one computer to another compute</li>
            <li>It is made up of semiconducting material. </li>
        </ol>
        There are two type of Primary memory.
        <dl>
            <dt>1.1) RAM: </dt>
            <dd>RAM stands for Random Access Memory, which stores data and instruction temporarily. It is also known as volatile memory that means data and instruction written in RAM gets erased away when electric power is c.ut off. A user can read as read from it and write in it. Hence, it is also known read-write memory. There are two types of RAM.</dd>
            <dt>SRAM</dt>
            <dd>It stands for Static Random Access Memory. It is made up of transistors. It is called static because it can remember its memory content without being refreshed or as long as there is power. SRAM doesn't need periodic refreshment like DRAM. It is faster than DRAM but more consume more electricity.</dd>
            <dt>DRAM</dt>
            <dd>It stand for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is made up of capacitors. It is called dynamic because it needs periodic refreshment and can remember its memory content only after being refreshed as long as there is electric charge in a capacitor. It consume less electricity and is less expensive but is slower than SRAM.</dd>
            <dt>1.2) ROM:</dt>
            <dd>ROM stands Read Only Memory where data and information are stored permanently.

<h1>Classification of computer on the Basis of Size</h1>
<div>As we know, technological development and precise engineering had drastically reduce the size of computers. Development of various electronic components are the major cause for reducing the size of the computer. Different types of computer on the basis of size are:</div>
<dl>
    <dt>1.Super Computer:</dt>
    <dd>This computer are one of the fastest and powerful digital computer which can perform only a particular types of jobs such as weather forecasting, rocket launching, population counting etc. They were tremendously huge in size and are very expensive. Due to this reason they are not commercially successful. They are used by large corporations and government agencies. They were large in size hence, it occupy much more space and require temperature controlled room.</dd>
    <dt>2.Mainframe Computer:</dt>
    <dd>This computer are also largest, fastest and perhaps one of the most expensive computer. Super computer are much more powerful and expensive but they are similar in size with mainframe computers. These computers have high processing unit and large storage capacity. This computer have multiple terminal. This computer can do big capacity of processing tasks such as population census, agro census, SLC result processing, governmental offices, industries etc. The first computer bought in Nepal in 2028 BS was IBM 1401, which was also a mainframe computer. This computer was bought in Nepal for population counting. Moreover, second computer bought in Nepal was ICL 2950/10 in 2038 BS which was also a mainframe computer brought for same purpose.</dd>
    <dt>3.Mini Computer:</dt>
    <dd>This computer are smaller than mainframe computer and are more powerful and expensive compare with micro-computer. They use terminal and are connected with more than 50 terminal at a time. Hence, it can handle much more amount of input and output than micro computer. The capability of mini computer is somewhere in between mainframe and micro computer. So, they are often called mid-range computer. This computer are used for medium size business, industries, universities, banks due to easy operation than mainframe computer. Eg, Data general, NECK, MAGNUM</dd>
    <dt>4.Micro Computer:</dt>
    <dd>These are the smallest computer develop till date they use micro-processor as their major processing unit. Hence, they are called micro-computers.
