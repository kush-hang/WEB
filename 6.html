    <h1>Introduction to the Internet</h1>
    <div>The Internet is the global network of networks. It is a huge collection of computers all over the world that are interconnected to one another in various ways to form a web-net.<br><br></div>

    <h2>Components Required for Internet Connections</h2>
    <div>The basic requirements for accessing the Internet are:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>A TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) enabled computer with a web browser.</li>
        <li>An account with an ISP (Internet Service Provider).</li>
        <li>A telephone line.</li>
        <li>A MODEM to connect to the telephone line and computer.</li>
        <li>A set of computer with the following capacity:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum 386 microprocessor chip with 16 MB RAM.</li>
            <li>Color monitor with 256 color support and 640x480 resolution.</li>
            <li>A hard disk with 200 MB free space.</li>
            <li>Multimedia sound card and speaker.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br>

    <h2>Internet Services and Applications</h2>
    <div>a) World Wide Web (WWW): WWW is a series of services that are interconnected through hypertext. It provides links in web documents. It is the most important service provided by the Internet. It was created in 1990 at the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, to exchange and share data through the Internet using the protocol known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br><br></div>

    <div>b) Web Browser: A web browser is a computer program that accesses web pages and displays them on a computer screen. It is client software that allows users to display and interact with web pages. It is the basic software needed to find, retrieve (open), view, send, and receive information over the Internet. Without a web browser, we cannot access the WWW. Some popular web browsers include Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Netscape Navigator.<br><br></div>

    <div>c) FTP - File Transfer Protocol: It is an Internet tool that permits an Internet user to move or transfer a file from one computer to another. The files may contain data, graphics, text, etc.<br><br></div>

    <div>d) Electronic Mail (E-mail): Sending and receiving messages electronically through the Internet is called E-mail. It is the most widely used feature on the Internet. E-mail messages include a variety of digital text, graphics, video, animation, and audio data.<br><br></div>

    <div>e) Voicemail: Voicemail is a service offered by specialized computer hardware and software that answers telephone calls and records audio messages. It allows easy communication with people.<br><br></div>

    <div>f) USENET â€“ View and News: View and News, or USENET, is the BBS (Bulletin Board Service) of the Internet. The messages in this BBS are organized into thousands of newsgroups, which cover specific areas of interest.<br><br></div>

    <div>g) Chat: Chat is a special feature provided by the Internet to communicate with others by typing in real time. A user can log into any chat room and connect with anyone online. It is an easy way to exchange ideas, feelings, and information. The facility of offline messaging is also provided if your friend is not online.<br><br></div>

    <div>h) IRC: Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a huge multi-user live chat facility. There are several major IRC servers around the world, which are linked to each other. Anyone can create a channel, and all others in the channel can see anything that anyone types.<br><br></div>

    <div>i) Video Conferencing: Known as webcam chatting, this service uses the same technology as IRC but also provides sound and video. It enables direct face-to-face communication across networks and offers real-time visual communication (online chat).<br><br></div>

    <div>j) Universal Resource Locator (URL): A URL is a unique address that identifies its location on the Internet. Web browsers utilize the URL to retrieve a file from the computer on which it resides. The format of the URL is as follows:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>http - protocol</li>
            <li>www - host computer name</li>
            <li>animalplanet - domain name</li>
            <li>com - domain type</li>
        </ul><br></div>

    <div>k) E-Fax (Electronic Fax): This facility allows sending and receiving faxes directly on our computer, similar to E-mail. The E-Fax message first goes to the Internet server, and then the server sends it to its destination, whereas an E-mail message goes to the local file server.<br><br></div>
    <br><br><br>

    <h2>Some Common Terminologies of Web Designing</h2>
    <div>a. Webpage: It is generally an HTML document or written in any other scripting language that helps execute information in the form of text, images, or any other components through the internet, called a webpage.<br><br></div>

    <div>b. Website: The collection of interrelated webpages is known as a website. It may contain any piece of information or may have information that is interrelated with several webpages connected through hyperlinks. All websites have two parts:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Domain Name: The name used to access the website.</li>
        <li>Web Server: It is a storage location where every piece of information associated with the website is stored.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <div>c. Home Page: The introductory page that is executed first when we access the website.<br><br></div>

    <div>d. Web Browser: It is an application program that helps access any content of webpages that may be in any form using HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol). This protocol helps facilitate communication between the web browser and the web server. Examples include Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (Microsoft Edge), Safari, Mozilla Firefox, and Netscape Navigator.<br><br></div>

    <div>e. URL: It stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a standard way of referencing a protocol, host, and directory.<br><br></div>

    <h2>DBMS (Database Management System)</h2>
    <div>Data: Data are the raw facts and figures. They are isolated, uninterpreted, and do not provide any sense unless processed. Simply, they are entities collected from the random world which undergo processing. For example, Ram, 19, 12, Pokhara.<br><br></div>

    <div>Information: Information is the meaningful result obtained after processing data, providing some meaning and sense. Generally, it is a processed version of data. For example, Ram is a student whose age is 19, and he lives in Pokhara-12.<br><br></div>

    <div>Information is obtained after processing data. Therefore, systematic and scientific arrangement and organization of data allow for quick and easy retrieval. This organized collection of data for converting data into information is called a database. Examples include a dictionary, mark ledger, census, and telephone directory.<br><br></div>

    <div>Since manual collection and organization of data is time-consuming, unsecured, and complex, an application program helps maintain the database, allowing for systematic and scientific organization and collection of data. The software or system built to fulfill this requirement is known as a Database Management System (DBMS). In other words, it is a collection of software that manages data stored in a database. The main purpose of DBMS is to store data, process it, and obtain desired information. Examples include MS Access, MySQL, Oracle, FoxPro, and dBase.<br><br></div>

    <h2>Advantages/Features/Importance of DBMS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It allows users to search quickly and easily.</li>
        <li>It helps to reduce data redundancy (repetition).</li>
        <li>It allows users to share data over a network.</li>
        <li>It helps in data security and privacy.</li>
        <li>It improves data inconsistency (variance).</li>
        <li>It provides an organized way of storing data.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Installation and operating costs are higher.</li>
        <li>It requires more disk space.</li>
        <li>There may sometimes be security and privacy issues.</li>
        <li>Technical manpower (DBA) is required to maintain and operate.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br>
