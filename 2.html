<h1>Introduction: Boolean Logic</h1>
<div>Boolean Algebra is algebra of logic, which deals with the study of binary variables and logical operation. As every data are represented in terms  binary values, we need to manipulate those values by using some certain rules and expression which we can do through Boolean algebra. It is most common and basic method to analysis and design logic circuit. It was introduced by an English mathematician George Boole. In Boolean algebra the variables can have only one of the two possible value 0 and1 (False or True). Every modern digital computers understand either this two values.</div>
<dl>
    <dt>Boolean algebra:</dt>
    <dd>It is algebra of logic which could accept either of the possible two values 0 and 1 and generate a result through logical relationship and operation.</dd>
    <dt>Boolean variable:</dt>
    <dd>Those entities which has either or 0 and 1 and denote some specific operation ore known as boolean variable. Simply, it is an entity in Boolean algebra which has only either of the two possible values. This variable are denoted by A, B, P, Q, X, Y, Z….</dd>
    <dt>Boolean function (logic functions):</dt>
    <dd>Boolean function is an expression formed by binary variables, binary operators such as AND, OR, NOT, parentheses, and equal sign for a given set of value this boolean function gives the 0 or 1 as a result.
        let us consider,<br>
        F = XYZ’+XY<br><br>
        Where, F is a boolean function<br><br>
        X, Y, Z are a boolean variable<br><br>
        X, Y, Z, Z’ are also literals.<br><br>
    </dd>
    <dt>Truth Table:</dt>
    <dd>A table which represents the input-output  relationship between of the binary variables for each logical gate called truth table. It shows the relationship between input and output in tabular form. Thus, truth table is table representing the results the logical operation of the logical operation on all possible combination of logical values.</dd>
    <dt>Boolean Operator and Operands</dt>
    <dd>Operators are the symbols that define the specific operation. These are three basic operators used in Boolean Algebra, ie. AND, OR, NOT. Every other operations can be expressed in terms of this basic operation. For examples, NOR operator is the combination of NOT and OR operators. The three basic operators are:
        <dl><dt>a. AND Operators:</dt> 
            <dd>AND operator is represented by “.” So, A AND B is represented by (A.B) . The  result of the AND operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic multiplication. That means result will be high (1) only when both the inputs are high. Note: A AND B can also represented bu  AˆB or AnB. Truth table of AND operation is given below

            <dd>
                OR operator is represented by “+” So, A OR B is represented by (A+B) . The  result of the OR operation is exactly same as simple arithmetic addition. That means result will be low (0) if and only both the inputs are low. Note: A OR B can also represented bu  AvB or AuB. Truth table of AND operation is given below

            <dd>
                NOT Gate is another fundamental gate whose result is complement of its input. It is also called inverter. It produces low-0 logic for high-1 input and vice-versa. This Gate has single input and single output. Graphically NOT gate is represented as:

            <dd>NAND gate is a derived gate, derived from NOT and AND gate. This gate reciprocal the output obtain from the AND gate. That means it will produce low-0 output when both the inputs are high-1 and produce high-1 output when any one of the input is low-0. These gate also may have two or more than two and a single output.

That means NOR gate will produce high-1 logic when both the inputs are low-0 and produce low output-0 in all possible combination of 0 and 1. These gate also may have two or more than two input at a single output.
