        <h1>Information Security</h1>
        As we know, in a network or cyberspace there is always a threat of cyber attacks which may lead to loss and damages of our precious data and information. It is always necessary to be aware of such malicious activity. We need to adopt different measures while using a computer from such intentional and accidental activities. Thus, information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction. We can use several physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from such unethical activities. Information security helps to create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs.<br><br>

        Information security can mitigate security threats and security attacks. Security threats are possible dangers that might cause unwanted activities in our computer system to breach security and thus cause possible harm, whereas a security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to destroy, expose, steal, or alter others' valuable data and information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, etc.<br><br>

        Information security is built around three major objectives:<br><br>

        <dl>
            <dd>1. Confidentiality</dd>
            <dd>It means information is available only for the authorized individual, that is, individuals or any other system cannot use or process others' information without proper authorization.</dd><br>
            
            <dd>2. Integrity</dd>
            <dd>It indicates accuracy and completeness of data and information, which means without proper authorization, data and information cannot be tampered.</dd><br>
            
            <dd>3.Availability</dd>
            <dd>It means information must always be available as per the requirement of the user. It generally refers to accessing our valuable data and information whenever required without delay.</dd>

        <h1>Cryptography</h1>
        The term cryptography is derived from the Greek word meaning “secret writing.” Cryptography is the art and science of hiding information. It provides security for information and is used for secure communication between individuals, government agencies, and military forces. Cryptography mostly refers to encryption and decryption.<br><br>

        Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (the message) into an unreadable format, so that anyone who tries to see the message cannot read the original content. The plaintext is converted into unreadable text using special algorithms and keys. The unreadable text is called ciphertext. This ciphertext can be converted back into readable form through the process of decryption. Decryption is the reverse process of encryption. Sometimes, encryption is also termed as encoding or enciphering, and its reverse process, decryption, is also termed as decoding or deciphering.<br><br>

        <h1>Digital Divide</h1>
        Digital Divide is the term used for the gap between computer-literate and illiterate individuals. It refers to the division between technical and non-technical manpower in the field. Information Technology (IT) encompasses modern technology, and to use this technology effectively, one needs a sound knowledge of computers. However, a significant number of people still do not know how to operate computers and do not understand computer-related terms. This difference or gap is called the digital divide.<br><br>

        The term first came into practice in the mid-1990s through political speeches and news media. This division is increasing daily between urban and rural populations, educated and uneducated individuals, rich and poor, and so on. As a result, it has become a global issue, and governments are striving to bridge this gap.<br><br>

        <h1>Cyber Ethics</h1>
        Computer ethics, or cyber ethics, are sets of moral principles or codes of conduct that should be strictly followed by computer professionals. The intention of computer or cyber ethics is to prevent criminal activities through the use of computers. Here are some examples of computer ethics:<br><br>

        <dl>
            <dd>1. Do not use others’ passwords</dd>
            <dd>2. Do not steal others’ information</dd>
            <dd>3. Do not use computers to harm others</dd>
            <dd>4. Do not disclose others’ secrets</dd>
            <dd>5. Do not spread viruses in the network</dd>
            <dd>6. Do not copy licensed software that you have not paid for</dd>
            <dd>7. Do not alter others’ data</dd>
            <dd>8. Do not take possession of other people’s intellectual property</dd>
            <dd>9. Do not misuse electronic transactions</dd>
            <dd>10. Do not use computers to bear false witness</dd>
        </dl><br><br>

    <br><br>
    <div>
        <h1>Cyber Crimes</h1>
        The act of misusing computers, the Internet, or other electronic media is called cyber crime. As the use of Information Technology increases, the incidence of cyber crime is also rising day by day. Here are some examples of cyber crime:<br><br>

        <dl>
            <dd>1. Misuse of computers</dd>
            <dd>2. Spreading viruses</dd>
            <dd>3. Stealing others’ information</dd>
            <dd>4. Pirating licensed software</dd>

        <h1>Cyber Law</h1>
        The law regarding the use of computers is called Cyber Law. It primarily concerns the misuse of computers, the Internet, and other electronic media, which are specially used for information flow. While cyber ethics suggest not committing computer crimes or cyber crimes, cyber law strictly defines the punishments in case of violations of these laws or cyber principles. Essentially, cyber law is in place to support cyber ethics. The Nepal Government also issued the Cyber Law on 11th Falgun, 2061 (18th March 2005) as “The Electronic Transaction Ordinance, 2005.”<br><br>

        It includes the following provisions:<br><br>
