    <h2>Introduction to Multimedia</h2>
    <div>Multimedia consists of two words: ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’, where multi means many and media means a way or medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms. The information can be expressed in text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.<br><br></div>

    <div>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and greater understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) by using a multimedia computer system. The integration of different forms of media is mandatory for effective communication. A multimedia computer system consists of multimedia hardware and multimedia software. Printers, projectors, webcams, microphones, digital cameras, etc., are some of the widely used multimedia computer hardware. Similarly, software like text editors (MS Word), presentation tools (PowerPoint), photo editing (Photoshop), video editing (iMovie), and accounting packages (Tally) are used as multimedia software. These multimedia hardware and software work together to integrate several components of multimedia. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.<br><br></div>

    <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>
    <div><strong>Text:</strong> It is the collection of alphanumeric values or any characters. It can be a word, a single line, or a paragraph. We can create and customize text using several text editors or word processors such as MS Word, Notepad, etc. It is the basic form of expressing information. By using multimedia software, we can customize the text by changing its size, color, type, style, etc. Extensions of text documents include .docx, .txt, etc.<br><br></div>

    <div><strong>Graphics / Images:</strong> “A picture is worth a thousand words," which means a picture can describe things more than text. Graphics generally refer to images or pictures. The smallest element of a picture is called a pixel (Picture Element). Hence, the quality of an image or picture is denoted by the number of pixels available, generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software such as Adobe Photoshop, CorelDRAW, Adobe InDesign, etc. Extensions of images include .jpeg, .png, etc.<br><br></div>

    <div><strong>Audio:</strong> Audio is one of the important components of multimedia. It provides the sensation of hearing and can enhance the understanding of any particular topic. Audio can include human voice, instrumental notes, natural sounds, digitally synthesized sounds, and many more. Nowadays, audio can be transferred from one place to another by converting it into a digital signal. FM radio uses this component to express information. Several multimedia software such as Windows Media Player can be used to play audio. Extensions of audio include .mp3, .wma, etc.<br><br></div>

    <div><strong>Video:</strong> Video consists of running frames of static pictures, meaning videos are generated by capturing a maximum number of images in a unit of time. Frames per second (FPS) is the term widely used to describe the smoothness of a video. Generally, 15-25 FPS creates smooth movement in video, but 30 and 60 FPS are the widely used standards in different devices. We can use different multimedia software such as iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Filmora, etc., to edit and customize our videos. Extensions of videos include .mp4, .mpeg, etc.<br><br></div>

    <div><strong>Animation:</strong> Animation is a sequence of vector (computer-generated) images displayed in rapid succession to provide visual effects. These images are computer-based. Animation is created to express ideas where complex explanations should be effectively delivered. These components are widely used in the movie industry and other entertainment sectors. Animation can be either 2D or 3D, with 3D animation being more realistic. Different movies use 3D animation to express information that is not feasible in real life. We use several multimedia software such as Maya Animation, AutoCAD, Macromedia Flash, etc. Extensions of animation include .flv, .gif, etc.<br><br>
       
            <h1>Types of Animations</h1>
        
            <h2>1. 2D Animation</h2>
            <div>2D animation involves creating movement in a two-dimensional space. This type of animation is often used in cartoons and simple graphics.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Animated GIFs are a popular form of 2D animation.<br>
            <div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="16674175" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.20755" data-width="50%"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/mickey-mouse-steamboat-willie-1928-disney-gif-16674175">Mickey Mouse Steamboat Willie GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/mickey+mouse-gifs">Mickey Mouse GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script><br><br></div>
        
            <h2>2. 3D Animation</h2>
            <div>3D animation uses three-dimensional models to create more realistic movements and environments. It is widely used in movies and video games.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Animated films like "Toy Story" utilize 3D animation techniques.<br>
            <iframe width="500" height="246" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxwTLktovTU" title="Toy Story | Original Trailer | Disney+" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br></div>
        
            <h2>3. Stop Motion Animation</h2>
            <div>Stop motion animation involves capturing still images of objects in various positions to create the illusion of movement when played in sequence.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Films like "Coraline" use stop motion animation.<br>
            <iframe width="500" height="246" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WwGYDA8RYZc" title="Shaun the Sheep! Complete Full Episodes Compilation | Shaun the Sheep" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br></div>
        
            <h2>4. Motion Graphics</h2>
            <div>Motion graphics involve animated graphic design elements, often used in advertisements and title sequences.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Title sequences in movies often utilize motion graphics.<br>
<br><br></div>
        
            <h2>5. 3D Modeling Animation</h2>
            <div>This type of animation involves creating three-dimensional representations of objects and characters, which can be manipulated for animation.<br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Architectural visualizations often use 3D modeling animations.<br>
