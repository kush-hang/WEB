    <h1>Data and Information</h1>
    <p>Data is a collection of facts, figures, or information that can be processed, analyzed, or used for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. It can be numerical, textual, or even descriptions of things. Essentially, data is the raw material that can be transformed into meaningful information.<br>
     On that note, in the context of computers, "information" refers to data that has been processed and organized, making it meaningful and useful for the user or the computer itself</p>
     <h1>Features of Information</h1>  
     <dl>
      <dt> 1. Accuracy:</dt>
      <dd>Information should be correct and free from errors, reflecting a faithful representation of the real world. </dd>
      <dt>2. Relevance:</dt>
      <dd>The information should be pertinent and appropriate to the context in which it's being used. </dd>
      <dt>3. Completeness:</dt>
      <dd>Information should include all necessary facts and details to be useful. </dd>
      <dt>4. Timeliness:</dt>
      <dd>Information should be available when needed, before its value diminishes. </dd>
      <dt>5. Accessibility:</dt>
      <dd>Information should be readily available and easy to find and understand. </dd>
      <dt>6. Clarity:</dt>
      <dd>Information should be easy to understand and free from ambiguity. </dd>
      <dt>7. Impartiality:</dt>
      <dd> Information should be free from bias and present a balanced view. </dd>
      <dt>8. Reliability:</dt>
      <dd>Information should be trustworthy and consistent, ensuring its accuracy over time.</dd>
     </dl>
     <h1>Database and its Purpose</h1>
     <div>A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system. The purpose of database is:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>DBMS maintains the reliability and accuracy of the information and returns it through enforced constraints and rules defined in the database schema that eliminates data redundancy and anomalies, respectively.</li>
      <li>Protecting confidential data is crucial and database systems successfully achieve this with their safeguards against unauthorized access.</li>
      <li>Databases ensure data consistency across various applications.</li>
      <li>Databases safeguards data against system crashes and failures is their main priority.</li>
      <li>Databases allow for the efficient storage and retrieval of data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Common Terminologies in Database</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>1.Table<dt>
      <dd>A table is a collection of related data in an organized manner in the form of rows and columns. It is an organized arrangement of data and information in tabular form containing rows and columns, making it easier to understand and compare data.</dd>
      <dt>2.Field</dt>
      <dd>In a database, a field is a single piece of data, typically within a table, representing a specific characteristic or attribute of a record. In other words it is the columb of a table in a database.</dd>
       <dt>3.Record</dt>
       <dd>In a database, a record (also known as a row or tuple) is a collection of related data elements, often called fields or attributes, that describe a single entity or instance within a table.</dd>
       <dt>4.Object</dt>
       <dd>In a database, a record (also known as a row or tuple) is a collection of related data elements, often called fields or attributes, that describe a single entity or instance within a table.</dd>
       <dt>5.Key</dt>
       <dd>A "key" refers to a special type of column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row in a table. Keys are essential for organizing data, ensuring data integrity, and establishing relationships between tables. </dd>
       <dt>6.Data Dictionary</dt>
       <dd>It describes the meanings and purposes of data elements within the context of a project, and provides guidance on interpretation, accepted meanings and representation</dd>
</dl>
<h1>Database Management System:</h1>
<div>A DBMS is a system that allows users to create, modify, and query databases while ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data access. Unlike traditional file systems, DBMS minimizes data redundancy, prevents inconsistencies, and simplifies data management with features like concurrent access and backup mechanisms. It organizes data into tables, views, schemas, and reports, providing a structured approach to data management.</div>
